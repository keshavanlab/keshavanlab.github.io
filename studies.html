					BICEPS
				</h3>
				<p text-left">
					Brain Imaging and Cognitive Enhancement in Early Phase of Schizophrenia (BICEPS) is a study funded in 2012 by the National Institute of Mental Health.The purpose of the BICEPS study is to understand how psychotherapy treatments work in people with early phase of schizophrenia using state-of the art and safe brain imaging studies.In order to do this, people recently diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder will be recruited at two sites, in Boston, MA and Pittsburgh, PA. These persons will receive either Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (CET) or Enriched Supportive Therapy (EST) for a period of 18 months and will be followed up to examine the effectiveness and brain mechanisms underlying these treatments.<br /><br /><a href="participate-.html">Contact: Dr. Luis Sandoval, PhD</a>

					B-SNIP
				</h3>
				<p >
					B-SNIP is a large-scale study, funded in 2007 by the National Institute of Mental Health. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder both "run in families" although how they are inherited and which genes and environmental factors are the most relevant are not well understood. Neither is it clear how these factors affect brain structure and function, personality or cognitive abilities.The purpose of the B-SNIP study is to discover how the risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is transmitted in families, to identify the most important risk genes and to measure the other factors listed above. Because the study is interested in measuring risk for the illnesses, we are as interested in assessing close family members as we are in examining people with the actual disorder.In order to do this, several thousand people will be recruited at fives sites throughout the United States, in Hartford/New Haven, CT, Athens, GA, Chicago, IL, Dallas, TX and Boston, MA. The study will assess people with schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorder, or bipolar (manic-depressive) illness on a variety of biological and genetic measures that seem to be associated with risk for the disorder.<br /><br /><a href="participate-.html">Contact: Laura Von Hardenberg</a>

					CLUES
				</h3>
				<p >
					"CLUES" stand for: Cognition for Learning and for Understand Everyday Social Situations.CLUES is designed to help improve attention, thinking, memory, and social skills in young people ages 16-30, who are being treated at the CEDAR clinic. CLUES, an NIMH-funded study, is based on a program called Cognitive Enhancement Therapy, which was found to help people with certain psychiatric conditions and significantly improve their thinking, work, and social functioning.CLUES is individually tailored to focus on helping participants to identify and achieve specific goals that are important to them.<br /><br /><a href="participate-.html">Contact: Dr. Michelle Friedman-Yakoobian, PhD</a>

					SMART Study

				<p class="text-left">
					Symptom Monitoring Application in Real Time (SMART) for Schizophrenia<br /><br />The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility and utility of a novel smartphone application for monitoring symptoms of illness in patients with psychotic disorders (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder with psychotic features). We will assess whether active data (surveys conducted on the smartphone) and passive data (data automatically collected by the smartphone such as GPS, accelerometer, voice recording from reading preset paragraphs etc.) have correlation to symptoms as documented in routine clinical visits. We will also examine the sensitivity of detection of early symptoms by the app vs. paper and pencil assessments. Of note, this protocol does not involve any treatment or interventions.<br /><br /><a href="participate-.html">Contact: Dr. John Torous, MD</a>

					Think and Move Study
				</h3>
				<p>
					We have developed an approach (Think &amp;Move , T&amp;M) to improve cognitive and physical fitness in a synchronized manner. In this pilot feasibility trial supported by the Sydney Baer Foundation, , we seek to examine our predictions that the T&amp;M program will be: a) feasible and b) engaging and user-friendly. We will also examine whether participating in this program will improve cognitive abilities. If our hypotheses are supported, our next step will be to develop a controlled clinical trial to show the efficacy of this intervention in a group of patients with schizophrenia with comorbid medical problems.<br /><br /><a href="participate-.html">Contact: Dr. Luis Sandoval, PhD</a>

					Sleep Study

					SPARCS (Sleep, Psychosis Associated Risk, and Cognition Studies) is an NIMH funded study that will investigate the mechanisms underlying cognition in healthy, young people and those with early course psychotic disorder. In particular, we study brain activity during sleep, which may inform us about these mechanisms.<br /><br /><a href="participate-.html">Contact: Kiran Singh</a>
